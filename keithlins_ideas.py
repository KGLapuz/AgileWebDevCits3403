# These are my ideas for the project so far!

#idea 1
print('Commission organizer social media')
'''specifically to help organize the commissions between clients and commissionee.

Ive always noticed most commissionees only handle their commissions through their normal social media handle,
making it harder for clients and commissionees to track the progress of their commission and often lead to numerous scams.
to prevent this, ive thought of possible features we could make depending on what type of user is the account:

commissionee:
- they can create commission options, prices can be set and options can be archived for client reviews
- commission options can be then be promoted in fyp

clients:
- they can leave comment and star reviews of a particular commissionee or commission option

both:
- they can communicate through direct messages
- a commission progress tracker, updated by the commissionee.
- transactions are available. 
- both can have profiles. commissionee's a 'shop' while clients a 'dashboard' 
- their own fyp to discover other commissionees. filtered with tags they can make.
- report button

#idea 2 
print('sign language lingo')
'''a take on duolingo's approach to learning foreign languages except this website is specific on sign language.

Sign language isn't exactly common knowledge within our society. However, to some it is the only way they can communicate to us.
By learning sign language we can close the communication gap in our diverse society allowing for awareness and inclusivity. 

while I have never learnt this type of communication before, it sounds like a good opportunity to learn it along the way. if you guys dont mind it too.

features:
- a main mechanism of utilising hand gesture detection and pairing it with a library of existing sign languages
- category of different sign languages (but we can focus on a specific one for this project and infer that other sign languages are thought of)
- a reviewable gesture guide, including videos. 
- feedback option 
- leaderboard system
- streak system

#idea 3
print('event planner')
''' manage events between casual hangouts or large events.
planning events in group chats whether you make new ones to specifically plan the event or use an existing chat can cause clutter in our dms
and distruption to conversations. in personal past experience, I've often lost track of which group chats are temporary and even event plans are
lost inside the sea of other conversations. hopefully making these features in the webapp could atleast alleviate this problem

features:
- user dashboard: personal calendar: where they can add which days they have available and existing events planned out,
current chats and archived chats. They can also create chats and large event options here

for small group hangouts:
- in current chats, there will be dashboard option to show a calendar collecting of everyone's availability as theyve added in their own personal calendar,
there will also be notes options so that users can customize it to add place, time, roles, etc
- archived chats, everyone in the chat can contribute all their photos from the event, laid out in a grid gallery where users can pick and choose what to download.
- friending system through qr code or friend through mutual event
- chat invitation qr code or invitation through already existing friend.

for large events:
- large events: user must already thought out place, time to customize their invitation card. they can send this via qr code or existing friends.
it is exclusively an invitation where people RSVP before the due date and leave comments such as dietary or contact if they are guest users
- RSVP from large events: after due date, the website display how many attending guest and contacts of each for the host and even sends a summary through email
- they will also have grid gallery for photos.
